                <p>
                    Based on our discussions, we have identified the following key functional areas for the Odoo
                    implementation:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Sales Management:</strong>
                        The client requires customizations in the sales workflow to ensure that quotes, orders,
                        and invoices are efficiently processed. They need a system that can handle complex
                        pricing rules, discounts, and commission tracking.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Inventory and Warehouse Management:</strong>
                        A crucial need is the ability to track inventory levels in real-time, automate stock
                        reordering, and improve stock movement tracking. The client also needs advanced
                        reporting on warehouse performance and stock valuation.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Manufacturing:</strong>
                        The client requires Odoo’s manufacturing module to be customized to better manage
                        production scheduling, bill of materials, work orders, and product lifecycle management.
                        The goal is to minimize lead times and enhance production efficiency.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Accounting and Finance:</strong>
                        Odoo’s accounting system needs to be configured to meet the client’s tax regulations,
                        multi-currency support, and financial reporting requirements. This will ensure smooth
                        integration with other departments and allow for detailed financial analysis.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Human Resources:</strong>
                        The client needs the HR module to be customized to handle recruitment, attendance,
                        payroll, and performance evaluations. They are also looking for enhanced reporting and
                        analytics on employee data.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Reporting and Analytics:</strong>
                        The client requires advanced reporting capabilities that allow easy access to
                        performance metrics, sales data, inventory analysis, and financial reports. Custom
                        dashboards and reports need to be integrated into the system for better decision-making.
